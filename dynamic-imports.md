Dynamic Imports in Vue for better performance

I bet you are already familiar with the terms
[**"code splitting"**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) and **"lazy loading"**.
Let's take the latter's definition from
[Webpack's docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/lazy-loading):

> Lazy, or "on demand", loading is a great way to optimize your site or application.
> This practice essentially involves splitting your code at logical breakpoints,
> and then loading it once the user has done something that requires, or will require,
> a new block of code. This speeds up the initial load of the application
> and lightens its overall weight as some blocks may never even be loaded.

This kind of feature should be done by default by the frameworks we use, as
[some people have suggested](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1018880523446337536).
(Also in the [React ecosystem](https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1031934342132461568))

#### The meat:

Whenever it's possible, I'd recommend to use dynamic imports to import components.
They will be lazily loaded (by Webpack) when needed.


```diff
- import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent.js'
+ const MyComponent = () => import('~/components/MyComponent.js') // code splitting enabled!!
```

To be a little bit more specific: we should do this as far our imported components are not
needed for the
[first interaction](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive).
Because this technique loads things asynchronously and we would be delaying its interactivity.

#### The explanation:

When using Webpack to bundle your application, you may use different ways to work with modules
(ES Modules, CJS, AMD...). If you choose the ESM way (which is the recommended), you will have this
kind of syntax:

```
import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent.js';
```

Notice that there are several use cases where we would like to use asyncronous components.
As explained by Alex Jover in
[this article](https://alexjover.com/blog/lazy-load-in-vue-using-webpack-s-code-splitting/):

- In component importing
- In Vue Router, for components mapping
- In Vuex modules

Let's take a look at the syntax and focus on the `import` part.
If you are using Webpack (or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org)!),
that syntax is going to be transformed at _compilation time_ and these tools are going to use
`Promise`s to load asynchronously your assets/modules/components. Why the need of an arrow function,
you might be wondering: As Alex explained, we need to wrap the `import` with an arrow function to
be resolved (remember, promises...) only when executed.

To demonstrate that they are fully lazy loaded I've prepared a
[repository](https://github.com/gangsthub/dynamic-imports-example)
(using Nuxt.js). It has 2 pages, each of them use different techniques (**With** and **Without**
dynamic imports) to import 2 components (component "A" and component "B"). We will see how, when
loading the page with dynamic imports, webpack loads 2 separate files after the navigation. But,
the page component itself (`/without`) using regular `import`s, is heavier because it loads
everything at once.

Image shows network waterfall when navigating to both pages. And the differences between both
techniques (with and without dynamic imports)</p>

Yes, by using this technique, Webpack will create separate files ("chunks")
to load them when needed (lazily). Custom chunk naming can be done with
[Magic comments](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#magic-comments), but
that will be the subject of another article

<p id="desc2"><span role="img" aria-label="Arrow right emoji">âž¡</span>
Image shows the result of nuxt build. See how different chunks are created from components
A and B when dynamic imports are used!</p>

##### That's it!
